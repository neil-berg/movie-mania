## Motivation

Have you visited IMDB lately? There's a ton of great content, but it can be overwhelming at times, especially if you are simply looking to check out the details of a movie. With a goal of creating a site that provides easier access to movie information, I decided to build Movie Mania.

## Features

* [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) API connections
* React.js front-end
* Styled-components for CSS/animations
* Redux (with Reselect) for state management

## Hosting

* Netlify for hosting and continous deployment 

## Issues

Spot any issues or have ideas for improving Movie Mania? I'd love to hear them! Please file an issue and/or open a PR.
